### Facial Keypoints Detection Algorithm

The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images.
This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

  - Tracking faces in images and video
  - Analysing facial expressions
  - Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
  - Biometrics / face recognition
